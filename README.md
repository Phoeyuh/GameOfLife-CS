# GameOfLife-CS
A simplified version of John Conway's Game of Life

[INSTRUCTIONS]
The user can move the green cursor icon during the input process to turn on some of the matrix blocks. After that, just by pressing any key, he can watch the evolution of the matrix. Any process requires a click.

[MOVE] by using: [W][A][S][D]
[ACTIVATE BLOCKS] by using: [WW][AA][SS][DD]
[END THE INPUT PHASE] by using: [p]

The output of the matrix may cause some errors in the visualization of the ASCII blocks characters; if that happens, you can edit the function "StampaMatrice" with different characters.
